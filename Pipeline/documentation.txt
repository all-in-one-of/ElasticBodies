Elastic Bodies Pipeline Documentation

For any questions: contact Zack Misso (zack441@mac.com)

This file contains the documentation for every script and folder within the
Pipeline directory of the project. This file is broken into three sections. The
first section briefly describes the contents of every folder. The second section
describes the Geometry Generation portion of the pipeline and walks through every
script involved in that process. Lastly, the third section goes over the current
optimization methodology utilized by our pipeline and how it works / what is yet
to be done
